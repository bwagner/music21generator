# m21gen

Takes a [music21](https://web.mit.edu/music21/)-structure and generates the
[Python](https://www.python.org/) code required to replicate this music21-structure.

## Purpose
As a beginner using music21, it can be difficult to find the entry into the library. But
you might be experienced with a score editor like [musescore](https://musescore.org),
[finale](https://www.finalemusic.com), [sibelius](https://www.avid.com/sibelius). So, you could
start by creating a score using any of those editors, export it as [musicxml](https://www.musicxml.com),
read it using m21gen and then, generate the Python code that reproduces this document.
Finally, use this skeleton as a stepping stone and add procedural or generative aspects.
